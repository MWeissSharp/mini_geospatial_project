# mini_geospatial_project

This project was an assignment as part of my NSS Data Analytics cohort's introduction to geospatial analysis.

Each of us used the data.nashville.gov website to find GIS datasets to play with. Our instructions were to combine at least 2 data sets and produce a folium map. I chose to combine park data with historical marker data then public artwork data, plotting the markers and artwork that can be found within Nashville's parks. I then added popups to my maps that provided some details about the marker or artwork.
